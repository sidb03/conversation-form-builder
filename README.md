# Conversational Form Builder

It has two sections
-  List of possible Question/Answer components
-  A canvas where you can layout the conversation flow

To keep things simple we will only have two types of Question/Answer component

-  Simple question where user can type in their answer. The conversational flow creator can limit of max words in an answer
-  End conversation. The flow creator can choose any greeting to sign off with a link

The flow creator can drag and drop these elements in the canvas to create the conversation flow.

When a component is dropped inside the canvas, a modal appears that allows the flow creator to fill in the details like for a simple question component the flow creator can mention the question title.
